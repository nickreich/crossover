Example code for comparing power in cluster-randomized trials
=========

The files in this repository provide you with the ability to recreate the analyses that we ran while writing the paper "Improving efficiency in cluster-randomized study design and implementation: taking advantage of a crossover."

Files available here are:
* powerChecking.R -- the file that contains all the code to run the power calculations contained in the paper.
* run_20131024_bcv1.rda -- the workspace saved after running the code.
* randomEffectAnalysisFunc.R -- the file containing a modified random effect function with appropriate degrees of freedom.
* powerChecking_bcv1.Rout -- the output from the R BATCH session that saved the .rda file.
